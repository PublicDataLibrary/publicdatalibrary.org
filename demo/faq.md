Here are some of the most common questions about my campaign. If you have any questions, [contact me](/contact)

## How does Sergio feel about ... ?
My policies are posted [here](/on-the-issues), but if there's _any_ issue you do not see any information about, please [contact me.](/contact) I am excited to speak with voters over the phone, on Twitter, or over email. 

I will update my websites with new policy positions as they become available.

## What political party is this campaign?
The office of City Council Member is non-partisan, so this campaign is non-partisan. We believe that running on a non-partisan platform bring together all voters to accomplish great things for our District. Additionally, Sergio is not part of - and has never been part of - a political party. 

## How can I see campaign finance data?
All documents relating to campaign finance are online at the transparency page. Most documents remain completely un-dedicated. Some documents are partially redacted to protect social security numbers, bank account numbers, home addresses of campaign staff (but not the candidate,) and signatures to prevent fraud.

## Why does each document have multiple links?
A document may have an "Official" link which is a link to the city/government website with the filing. All documents have "Archive" links which are copies of the document stored in the [Internet Archive's](https://archive.org/about){: .usa-external_link}. This is to ensure that a true copy is always available, even if it were to be changed on this site or if this site were to go offline (for example, at the end of the campaign). The Internet Archive is a well-trusted source for historical copies of information, including full-text archival copies of webpages. Finally, some documents may have a generic link to a location on this site.
